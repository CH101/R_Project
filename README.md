# R_Projects

The repository *R_Projects* is set-up to host data science projects conducted with R Studio. From time to time, I will upload new projects that I have worked on either within my master studies, data science online courses or by my-self. As I am at the beginning of a long journey, I am kean to get in touch with other data scientist and to receive feedback on my work.  
Thank you for reading!
